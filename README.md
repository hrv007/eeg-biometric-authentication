# EEG-based Biometric Authentication System Using Convolutional Neural Network for Military Applications

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a novel EEG-based multi-subject and multi-task biometric authentication system specifically designed for military applications. The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to authenticate users based on their unique EEG signal patterns.

## Key Features

* Multi-subject, multi-session, and multi-task (M3CV) EEG-based authentication approach
* Preprocessing pipeline using bad channel repairing, ICA for artifact removal, downsampling, and audio filtering
* Feature extraction using mel spectrograms for improved model performance
* CNN-based deep learning architecture with exceptional accuracy (99.86% validation)
* Robust and reliable authentication mechanism for high-security military environments

## Military Applications

* Access control for artillery and weapons systems
* Entry verification for highly confidential areas
* Remote control systems for critical defense infrastructure
* Continuous user authentication during sensitive operations

## Results

* Validation accuracy: 99.86%
* Training accuracy: 98.49%
* Precision, recall, and F1-score: 99.91%
* Outperforms other state-of-the-art deep learning architectures
